Important notes"
- Terraform enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure.
- With Terraform, you can create your own custom provider plugins.

Task 1. Verifying Terraform installation
- Open a new Cloud Shell tab, and verify that Terraform is available:
  "terraform"
  
Task 2. Build Infrastructure
Confguration
1. In Cloud Shell, create an empty configuration file named instance.tf with the following command:
  "touch instance.tf"
2. Click Open Editor on the Cloud Shell toolbar.
3. Click the instance.tf file and add the necessary content in it.  There is a sample .tf file located in the folder in this respository.
4. In Cloud Shell, verify that your new file has been added and that there are no other *.tf files in your directory, because Terraform loads all of them:
  "ls"
Initialization
1. Download and install the provider binary:
  "terraform init"
2. Create an execution plan:
  "terraform plan"
Apply Changes
1. In the same directory as the instance.tf file you created, run this command:
  "terraform apply"
2. For this case the plan looks acceptable, so type yes at the confirmation prompt to proceed.
   Executing the plan will take a few minutes becasue Terraform waits for the VM instance to become available.
3. In the Google Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu, click Compute Engine > VM Instances.
   The VM instances page opens and you'll see the VM instance you just created in the VM instances list.
4. In Cloud Shell, inspect the current state:
   "terraform show"
