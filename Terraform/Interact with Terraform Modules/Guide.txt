Task 1. Use modules from the Registry
- Open the Terraform Registry page for the Terraform Network module in a new browser tab or window.
  https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/network/google/3.3.0
  Create a Terraform configuration
  1. To start, run the following commmands in Cloud Shell to clone the example simple project form the Google Terraform modules GitHub repository and switch to the v3.3.0 branch:
     git clone https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-network
     cd terraform-google-network
     git checkout tags/v3.3.0 -b v3.3.0
  2. On the Cloud Shell toolbar, click Open Editor.
     To switch between Cloud Shell and the code editor, clcik Open Editor or Open Terminal as required, or click Open in a new window to leave the Editor open in a separate tab.
  3. In the editor, navigate to terraform-google-network/examples/simple_project, and open the main.tf file.
     Your main.tf configuration will look like the main.tf in the current directory.
  Set values for module input variables
  - Within the module "test-vpc-module" block, review the input variables you are setting. 
    Each of these input variables is documented in the Terraform Registry.
    The required inputs for this module are:
    - network_name: The name of the network being created
    - project_id: The ID of the project where this VPC will be created
    - subnets: The list of subnets being created
  Define root input variables
  1. To retrieve your Project ID, run the following command in Cloud Shell:
     gcloud config list --format 'value(core.project)'
  2. In the Editor, still in the same directory, navigate to variables.tf.
  3. Fill in the variable project_id with the output of the previous command.
     You must follow the format below and set the default value for the variable:
     variable "project_id" {
      description = "The project ID to host the network in"
      default     = "FILL IN YOUR PROJECT ID HERE"
     }
  4. In variables.tf, fill in the variable network_name.
     You can use the name example-vpc or any other name you'd like.
     You must follow the format below and set the default value for the variable:
     variable "network_name" {
      description = "The name of the VPC network being created"
      default     = "example-vpc"
     }
  Define root output values
  - Navigate to the outputs.tf file inside of your configuration's directory.
    Verify that the file contains the items in the guide's outputs.tf file.
  Provision infrastructure
  1. In Cloud Shell, navigate to your simple_project directory:
     cd ~/terraform-google-network/examples/simple_project
  2. Initialize your Terraform configuration:
     terraform init
  3. Create your VPC:
     terraform apply
  4. To apply the changes and continue, respond to the prompt with yes.
  Clean up your infrastructure
  1. Destroy the infrastructure you created:
     terraform destroy
  2. Respond to the prompt with yes.
     Terraform will destroy the infrastructure you created
Task 2. Build a module
  Create a module
  1. Create the directory for your new module:
     cd ~
     touch main.tf
     mkdir -p modules/gcs-static-website-bucket
  2. Navigarte to the module directory and run the following commands to create three empty files:
     cd modules/gcs-static-website-bucket
     touch website.tf variables.tf outputs.tf
  3. Inside the gcs-static-website-bucket directory, create a file called README.md with the following content:
     # GCS static website bucket
     This module provisions Cloud Storage buckets configured for static website hosting.
  4. Create another file called LICENSE with the following content:
     Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
     You may obtain a copy of the License at
      http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

     See the License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the License.
  5. Add the Cloud Storage bucket resource show in the example website.tf file to your website.tf file inside the modules/gcs-static-website-bucket directory.
  6. Navigate to the variables.tf file in your module and add the code given in the example variables.tf file.
  7. Add an output to your module in the outputs.tf file inside your module:
     output "bucket" {
      description = "The created storage bucket"
      value       = google_storage_bucket.bucket
     }
  8. Return to the main.tf in your root directory and add a reference to the new module:
     module "gcs-static-website-bucket" {
      source = "./modules/gcs-static-website-bucket"
      name       = var.name
      project_id = var.project_id
      location   = "us-east1"
      lifecycle_rules = [{
        action = {
          type = "Delete"
        }
        condition = {
          age        = 365
          with_state = "ANY"
        }
      }]
     }
  9. In your home directory, create an outputs.tf file for your root module:
     cd ~
     touch outputs.tf
 10. Add the following code in the outputs.tf file:
     output "bucket-name" {
      description = "Bucket names."
      value       = "module.gcs-static-website-bucket.bucket"
     }
 11. In your home directory, create a variables.tf file:
     touch variables.tf
 12. Add the following code to the variables.tf file and define the variables project_id and name:
     variable "project_id" {
      description = "The ID of the project in which to provision resources."
      type        = string
      default     = "FILL IN YOUR PROJECT ID HERE"
     }
     variable "name" {
      description = "Name of the buckets to create."
      type        = string
      default     = "FILL IN YOUR (UNIQUE) BUCKET NAME HERE"
     }
  Install the local module
  1. Install the module:
     terraform init
  2. Provision your bucket:
     terraform apply
  3. Respond yes to the prompt. Your bucket and other resources will be provisioned.
  Upload files to the bucket
  1. Download the sample contents to your home directory:
     cd ~
     curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-modules/master/modules/aws-s3-static-website-bucket/www/index.html > index.html
     curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-modules/blob/master/modules/aws-s3-static-website-bucket/www/error.html > error.html
  2. Copy the files over to the bucket, replacing YOUR-BUCKET-NAME with the name of your storage bucket:
     gsutil cp *.html gs://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME
  3. In a new tab in your browser, go to the website https://storage.cloud.google.com/YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/index.html, replacing YOUR-BUCKET-NAME with the name of your storage bucket.
  Clean up the website and infrastructure
  - Destroy your Terraform resources
    terraform destroy
