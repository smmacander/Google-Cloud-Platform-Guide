Task 1. Use modules from the Registry
- Open the Terraform Registry page for the Terraform Network module in a new browser tab or window.
  https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/network/google/3.3.0
  Create a Terraform configuration
  1. To start, run the following commmands in Cloud Shell to clone the example simple project form the Google Terraform modules GitHub repository and switch to the v3.3.0 branch:
     git clone https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-network
     cd terraform-google-network
     git checkout tags/v3.3.0 -b v3.3.0
  2. On the Cloud Shell toolbar, click Open Editor.
     To switch between Cloud Shell and the code editor, clcik Open Editor or Open Terminal as required, or click Open in a new window to leave the Editor open in a separate tab.
  3. In the editor, navigate to terraform-google-network/examples/simple_project, and open the main.tf file.
  Set values for module input variables
  - Within the module "test-vpc-module" block, review the input variables you are setting. 
    Each of these input variables is documented in the Terraform Registry.
    The required inputs for this module are:
    - network_name: The name of the network being created
    - project_id: The ID of the project where this VPC will be created
    - subnets: The list of subnets being created
  Define root input variables
  1. To retrieve your Project ID, run the following command in Cloud Shell:
     gcloud config list --format 'value(core.project)'
  2. In the Editor, still in the same directory, navigate to variables.tf.
  3. Fill in the variable project_id with the output of the previous command.
     You must follow the format below and set the default value for the variable:
     variable "project_id" {
      description = "The project ID to host the network in"
      default     = "FILL IN YOUR PROJECT ID HERE"
     }
  4. In variables.tf, fill in the variable network_name.
     You can use the name example-vpc or any other name you'd like.
     You must follow the format below and set the default value for the variable:
     variable "network_name" {
      description = "The name of the VPC network being created"
      default     = "example-vpc"
     }
