Task 1. Build Infrastructure
  1. Create the main.tf file:
     touch main.tf
  2. Click the open editor button on the toolbar of Cloud Shell.
  3. In the Editor, edit the main.tf file.  A sample main.tf file is included within this repository.
  Initialization
  - Initialize your new Terraform configuration by running the terraform init command in the same directory as your main.tf file:
    terraform init
  Creating resources
    1. Apply your configuration now by running the command terraform apply:
       terraform apply
    2. The plan looks acceptable here, so type yes at the confirmation prompt to proceed.
    3. In the Console, from the Navigation menu, navigate to VPC Network. You will see the terraform-network has been provisioned. 
    4. In Cloud Shell run the terraform show command to inspect the current state:
       terraform show
Task 2. Change Infrastructure
  Adding resources
    1. In the editor, add a compute instance resource to main.tf. (In sample file, post comment).
    2. Now run terraform apply to create the compute instance:
       terraform apply
    3. Once again, answer yes to the confirmation prompt.
  Changing resources
    1. Add a tags argument to your "vm_instance" so that it looks like the main.tf file (commented out section).
    2. Run terraform apply again to update the instance:
       terraform apply
    3. The prefix ~ means that Terraform will update the resource in place. Type in yes.
  Destructive changes
    1. Edit the boot disk block inside the vm_instance resource in your configuration file and change it to the commented out section in the main.tf file.
